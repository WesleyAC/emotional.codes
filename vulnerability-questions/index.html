			<h1 class="title">Vulnerability Questions</h1>

			<div class="content">
				<p>I want to have deep conversations with people, but often find myself getting stuck in small talk, unable to steer the conversation towards anything I find meaningful or interesting. It’s easy to end up having friends who I only end up making small talk or talking about work with, even if we both want a closer connection.</p>
<p>I think that the fundamental thing that makes this closer connection happen is vulnerability - in order to have a close connection with someone, it’s important to feel comfortable being vulnerable. However, it’s often really difficult to create space for people to be vulnerable! That’s why I have this list of questions that I answer with people to try to create space for vulnerability. I usually will tell people that I have this list, and then let them pick questions off of it if they’re interested.</p>
<ul>
<li>What things in your past have shaped the way you see things now or go about your life?</li>
<li>What do you want to be better at / change about yourself?</li>
<li>What aspects of femininity / masculinity do you like?</li>
<li>How much independence did you get from your parents growing up? Do you like the level of independence you had/have?</li>
<li>What emotion do you feel most often?</li>
<li>Would you want to be a parent? Why? How would you want to raise a kid?</li>
<li>What’s the worst thing you’ve done to someone?</li>
<li>What other career might you have ended up in?</li>

<li>What do you value most in a friendship?</li>
