title: Vulnerability Questions

I want to have deep conversations with people, but often find myself getting stuck in small talk, unable to steer the conversation towards anything I find meaningful or interesting. It's easy to end up having friends who I only end up making small talk or talking about work with, even if we both want a closer connection.

I think that the fundamental thing that makes this closer connection happen is vulnerability - in order to have a close connection with someone, it's important to feel comfortable being vulnerable. However, it's often really difficult to create space for people to be vulnerable! That's why I have this list of questions that I answer with people to try to create space for vulnerability. I usually will tell people that I have this list, and then let them pick questions off of it if they're interested.

* What things in your past have shaped the way you see things now or go about your life?
* What do you want to be better at / change about yourself?
* What aspects of femininity / masculinity do you like?
* How much independence did you get from your parents growing up? Do you like the level of independence you had/have?
* What emotion do you feel most often?
* Would you want to be a parent? Why? How would you want to raise a kid?
* What's the worst thing you've done to someone?
* What other career might you have ended up in?
* Should you seek power?
* What do you most like about yourself?
* What do you most dislike about yourself?
