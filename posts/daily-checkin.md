I recently had to stop attending the [feelings checkin](/feelings-checkin) group that I started, and found myself missing having a routine to reflect on how I'd been feeling. Shortly after I stopped feelings checkin, one of my friends became a housemate, and suggested that we have a nighttime checkin routine. We've developed a framework and set of questions that's been useful for us - I hope you find it useful as well :)

Each person answers these questions in order, and others chime in ad-hoc:

* What are two facts about your day?
* What was a good part of your day?
* Feel free to talk about a bad part of your day <3
* What's something someone did today that you appreciated?
* What's something you did today that someone else appreciated?
* What's something you learned today?
* What's something you're excited about tomorrow?
* Did you meet your goals for the day? How do you feel about that?
* What are your goals for tomorrow?
