				<p>I recently had to stop attending the <a href="/feelings-checkin">feelings checkin</a> group that I started, and found myself missing having a routine to reflect on how I’d been feeling. Shortly after I stopped feelings checkin, one of my friends became a housemate, and suggested that we have a nighttime checkin routine. We’ve developed a framework and set of questions that’s been useful for us - I hope you find it useful as well :)</p>
<p>Each person answers these questions in order, and others chime in ad-hoc:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are two facts about your day?</li>
<li>What was a good part of your day?</li>
<li>Feel free to talk about a bad part of your day &lt;3</li>
<li>What’s something someone did today that you appreciated?</li>
<li>What’s something you did today that someone else appreciated?</li>
<li>What’s something you learned today?</li>
<li>What’s something you’re excited about tomorrow?</li>
<li>Did you meet your goals for the day? How do you feel about that?</li>
<li>What are your goals for tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
